        <p>You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</p>

        <h2>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), Flowra legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
        <p>Flowra may process your Personal Data because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We need to perform a contract with you</li>
            <li>You have given us permission to do so</li>
            <li>The processing is in our legitimate interests and it is not overridden by your rights</li>
            <li>For payment processing purposes</li>    <li>To comply with the law</li>
        </ul>

            
        <h2>Retention of Data</h2>    
        <p>Flowra will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
        <p>Flowra will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.</p>    

        <h2>Transfer of Data</h2>
        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>If you are located outside Spain and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to Spain and process it there.</p>
        <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
        <p>Flowra will take all the steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organisation or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>

        <h2>Disclosure of Data</h2>

        <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>


        <h2>YouTube</h2>

        <p>Some content on the Service may use a video player embedded from YouTube, using YouTube API services.

        <ul>
                <li>

                <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service.

That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American
        Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.</p>
        <p>The payment processors we work with are:</p>

        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>


        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.
